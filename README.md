# Feasability Analysis of Ice Cream/Surf Shop

## Overview fo Project
  Dertermine if the ice cream and surf business financial plan is viable all year round.
  - ### Task included;
      * Gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.
      * We have also gathered information/data about percipitation, temperatures for the most recent year and specific weather station that was most active.

## Results
 * it was found that the data on temperatures for June and December over the years doesn't fluctate to as seen by the following charts

 * In terms of temperature there are some minor differences such as the avg/mean temp 
 * Also the the December Temps may have some cooler days more often 

## Summary

  * After Analysis it seems that Oahu is an ideal place to open a Surf n' Scoops Shop. The Shop would thrive on warm sunny days with ice cream sales and would sell surf merchandise on cooler or rainy days that are typically better to surf. Ensuring there are healthy alternatives for the harcore surfers such as "smoothies" would be a wasted opportunity.
  * Additional Queries should include;
      - Choose alternative islands and determine there June and Dec temperature readings with the same queries used here
      - Also
